# AUTH0 FRAGEN
<p id="com-faq"></p>
### Common	 	 

??? note "What exactly is Auth0?"

	<p><a href="https://auth0.com/de" target="_blank">Auth0</a> is a cloud-based platform for identity and access management. We use Auth0 to protect your MetaTrader Panel account from unauthorized access.
	</p>
	
	__How does it work?__  
	You register with Auth0 and enter your username and password as usual. When you start the local server, you will be asked for your username and password. 
	If the information is correct, Auth0 gives us the OK and we can be sure that it is really you logging into your account.
	

??? note "What does MetaTrader Panel use Auth0 for?"

    We use Auth0 to protect your MetaTrader panel account from unauthorized access.  
	With over 2.5 billion successful logins per month, Auth0 is one of the market leaders and always offers the latest security standards.

### Login

??? note "Where do I enter my password?"

    If your username and password are required, the dialog box will automatically appear on the screen.
	
??? note "How long is my login valid?"

    As long as your MetaTrader panel interface is open, your current session remains valid.  
	If you are logged out for more than 24 hours, you will need to re-authenticate.

??? note "Why my password isn't being saved?"

    An internal error in MS Edge prevents this. However, we are working on a solution.

??? note "I forgot my password. Can you send it to me?"

    No, we can't. We don't know your password, and it's not stored on our servers.  
	Please use the “Forgot password” feature in the Auth0 login dialog to reset your password.
